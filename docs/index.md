# Introduction to labelCloud

labelCloud is a lightweight tool for labeling 3D bounding boxes in point clouds.

![Overview of the Labeling Tool](assets/io_overview.png)

It is written in Python and can be installed via `pip` (see [Setup](setup.md)).

## Labeling
labelCloud supports two different ways of labeling (*picking* & *spanning*) as well as multiple mouse and keyboard options for subsequent correction.

(There is also a [short YouTube-Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GF9n1WeR8A) that introduces the tool.)

### Picking Mode

* Pick the location of the bounding box (front-top edge)
* Adjust the z-rotation by scrolling with your mouse wheel

### Spanning Mode

* Subsequently span the length, width and height of the bounding box by selecting four vertices
* The layers for for the last two vertices (width & height) will be locked to allow easy selection

### Correction

* Use the buttons on the left-hand side or shortcuts to correct the *translation*, *dimension* and *rotation* of the bounding box
* Resize the bounding box by holding your cursor above one side and scrolling with the mouse wheel

By default the x- and y-rotation of bounding boxes will be prohibited.
For labeling **9 DoF-Bounding Boxes** deactivate `z-Rotation Only Mode` in the menu, settings or `config.ini` file.
Now you will be free to rotate around all three axes.

## Import & Export Options
labelCloud is built for a versatile use and aims at supporting all common point cloud file formats and label formats for storing 3D bounding boxes.
The tool is designed to be easily adaptable to multiple use cases. To change the settings, simply edit the corresponding line in the `config.ini` (see [Configuration](configuration.md)) for a description of all parameters).

### Supported Point Cloud Formats

| Type      | File Formats                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Colored   | `*.pcd`, `*.ply`, `*.pts`, `*.xyzrgb` |
| Colorless | `*.xyz`, `*.xyzn`, `*.bin` (KITTI)    |

### Supported Label Formats

| Label Format          | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `centroid_rel`        | Centroid `[x, y, z]`; Dimensions `[length, width, height]`; <br> Relative Rotations as Euler angles in radians (-pi..+pi) `[yaw, pitch, roll]`                 |
| `centroid_abs`        | Centroid `[x, y, z]`; Dimensions `[length, width, height]`; <br> Absolute Rotations as Euler angles in degrees (0..360°) `[yaw, pitch, roll]`                  |
| `vertices`            | 8 Vertices of the bounding box each with `[x, y, z]` (see [Conventions](conventions.md) for order) |
| `kitti`               | Centroid; Dimensions; z-Rotation (See [specification](https://github.com/bostondiditeam/kitti/blob/master/resources/devkit_object/readme.txt))                 |
| `kitti_untransformed` | See above, but without transformations.                                                                                                                        |

You can easily create your own exporter by subclassing the abstract [BaseLabelFormat](https://github.com/ch-sa/labelCloud/blob/master/labelCloud/label_formats/base.py#L10).
All rotations are counterclockwise (i.e. a z-rotation of 90°/π is from the positive x- to the negative y-axis!).
